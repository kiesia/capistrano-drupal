Capistrano-Drupal
=================

This is a basic recipe for Drupal deployment with Capistrano. Currently this 
handles Drupal multisite installs when :sites is set.

Requirements
------------

The standard environment for capistrano deployment, plus:

+ Drush on the deployment server
+ The folowing extra rubygems:
  + capsitrano-ext
  + railsless-deploy

Setup process
-------------

Setup is largely automated, just open a terminal in your project root and 
enter:

`cap stage deploy:setup`

Where 'stage' is your target stage, such as _staging_ or _production_. This will:

+ create an app directory, prefixed with the stage name
+ created directories for shared files, such as files and .htaccess (on _staging_)

TODO upload a .htaccess file with password protection when setting up _staging_

Deploy process
--------------

To deploy, just open a terminal in the project root directory and enter:

`cap stage deploy`

This will deploy new code and clear the drupal cache with drush. There is also
an (untested) method which can compile sass files on deployment using drush.
